# Agent harness capabilities

We think of `deepagents` as an ["agent harness"](https://blog.langchain.com/agent-frameworks-runtimes-and-harnesses-oh-my/). It is the same core tool calling loop as other agent frameworks, but with built-in tools and capabilities.

```

This page lists out the components that make up the agent harness.

## File system access

The harness provides six tools for file system operations, making files first-class citizens in the agent's environment:

| Tool         | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ls`         | List files in a directory with metadata (size, modified time)                                 |
| `read_file`  | Read file contents with line numbers, supports offset/limit for large files                   |
| `write_file` | Create new files                                                                              |
| `edit_file`  | Perform exact string replacements in files (with global replace mode)                         |
| `glob`       | Find files matching patterns (e.g., `**/*.py`)                                                |
| `grep`       | Search file contents with multiple output modes (files only, content with context, or counts) |

## Large tool result eviction

The harness automatically dumps large tool results to the file system when they exceed a token threshold, preventing context window saturation.

**How it works:**

* Monitors tool call results for size (default threshold: 20,000 tokens)
* When exceeded, writes the result to a file instead
* Replaces the tool result with a concise reference to the file
* Agent can later read the file if needed

## Pluggable storage backends

The harness abstracts file system operations behind a protocol, allowing different storage strategies for different use cases.

**Available backends:**

1. **StateBackend** - Ephemeral in-memory storage
   * Files live in the agent's state (checkpointed with conversation)
   * Persists within a thread but not across threads
   * Useful for temporary working files

2. **FilesystemBackend** - Real filesystem access
   * Read/write from actual disk
   * Supports virtual mode (sandboxed to a root directory)
   * Integrates with system tools (ripgrep for grep)
   * Security features: path validation, size limits, symlink prevention

3. **StoreBackend** - Persistent cross-conversation storage
   * Uses LangGraph's BaseStore for durability
   * Namespaced per assistant\_id
   * Files persist across conversations
   * Useful for long-term memory or knowledge bases

4. **CompositeBackend** - Route different paths to different backends
   * Example: `/` → StateBackend, `/memories/` → StoreBackend
   * Longest-prefix matching for routing
   * Enables hybrid storage strategies

## Task delegation (subagents)

The harness allows the main agent to create ephemeral "subagents" for isolated multi-step tasks.

**Why it's useful:**

* **Context isolation** - Subagent's work doesn't clutter main agent's context
* **Parallel execution** - Multiple subagents can run concurrently
* **Specialization** - Subagents can have different tools/configurations
* **Token efficiency** - Large subtask context is compressed into a single result

**How it works:**

* Main agent has a `task` tool
* When invoked, creates a fresh agent instance with its own context
* Subagent executes autonomously until completion
* Returns a single final report to the main agent
* Subagents are stateless (can't send multiple messages back)

**Default subagent:**

* "general-purpose" subagent automatically available
* Has filesystem tools by default
* Can be customized with additional tools/middleware

**Custom subagents:**

* Define specialized subagents with specific tools
* Example: code-reviewer, web-researcher, test-runner
* Configure via `subagents` parameter

## Conversation history summarization

The harness automatically compresses old conversation history when token usage becomes excessive.

**Configuration:**

* Triggers at 170,000 tokens
* Keeps the most recent 6 messages intact
* Older messages are summarized by the model

**Why it's useful:**

* Enables very long conversations without hitting context limits
* Preserves recent context while compressing ancient history
* Transparent to the agent (appears as a special system message)

## Dangling tool call repair

The harness fixes message history when tool calls are interrupted or cancelled before receiving results.

**The problem:**

* Agent requests tool call: "Please run X"
* Tool call is interrupted (user cancels, error, etc.)
* Agent sees tool\_call in AIMessage but no corresponding ToolMessage
* This creates an invalid message sequence

**The solution:**

* Detects AIMessages with tool\_calls that have no results
* Creates synthetic ToolMessage responses indicating the call was cancelled
* Repairs the message history before agent execution

**Why it's useful:**

* Prevents agent confusion from incomplete message chains
* Gracefully handles interruptions and errors
* Maintains conversation coherence

## To-do list tracking

The harness provides a `write_todos` tool that agents can use to maintain a structured task list.

**Features:**

* Track multiple tasks with statuses (pending, in\_progress, completed)
* Persisted in agent state
* Helps agent organize complex multi-step work
* Useful for long-running tasks and planning

## Human-in-the-Loop

The harness pauses agent execution at specified tool calls to allow human approval/modification.

**Configuration:**

* Map tool names to interrupt configurations
* Example: `{"edit_file": True}` - pause before every edit
* Can provide approval messages or modify tool inputs

**Why it's useful:**

* Safety gates for destructive operations
* User verification before expensive API calls
* Interactive debugging and guidance

## Prompt caching (Anthropic)

The harness enables Anthropic's prompt caching feature to reduce redundant token processing.

**How it works:**

* Caches portions of the prompt that repeat across turns
* Significantly reduces latency and cost for long system prompts
* Automatically skips for non-Anthropic models

**Why it's useful:**

* System prompts (especially with filesystem docs) can be 5k+ tokens
* These repeat every turn without caching
* Caching provides \~10x speedup and cost reduction
